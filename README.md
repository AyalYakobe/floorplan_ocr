# Project Name

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive system for processing images, generating text, and evaluating outputs. It consists of several modules that work together to handle image processing, text generation, and evaluation of generated content. 

## Features
- **Image Processing**: Handles initial image processing tasks.
- **Text Generation**: Generates textual content based on processed images.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates generated text for accuracy and quality.
- **Combining Text with Images**: Integrates generated text with images to create cohesive outputs.
- **Main Module**: Coordinates different components to ensure seamless execution.

## File Descriptions
- `main.py`: The central script that orchestrates different modules.
- `initial_image_processing.py`: Handles image preprocessing and feature extraction.
- `text_generation.py`: Implements text generation algorithms.
- `combine_text_w_image.py`: Merges generated text with processed images.
- `simple_evaluation.py`: Provides a basic evaluation mechanism for generated content.
- `surya_evaluator.py`: Advanced evaluation mechanism for text and image alignment.

## Requirements
This project was developed using PyCharm.

## Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
